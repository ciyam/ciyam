Getting Started
---------------

After cloning the repository run "config" in order to configure the system for 3rd party dependencies (and to
set the default server port) then "make all" to build all of the targets and then run "do_tests" batch/script
to test that all core functionality is working:

./config
make all
./dotests

(Windows users need to omit the ./ prefixes)

The next step is to make sure that MySQL is installed and operating. The following steps will create a DB for
testing the system, populate this DB with tables and data and check that all is functioning as expected:

./create_db ciyam
./init Meta ciyam
./test Meta_tests.sio
./drop_db ciyam

The "ciyam" DB should only be used for regression test purposes (by repeating the above steps) so now another
DB needs to be created for the IDE itself:

./create_db Meta
./init Meta Meta

The next step is to make sure that the web server's FCGI is installed and operating. Run the following batch/
script to install the FCGI testbed:

./install_test_fcgi

Assuming no errors occurred you should now be able to access the webpage: http://localhost/test_fcgi.html

It will present a HTML form with a Perform Post Request button. To verify that FCGI is working correctly next
click on the button. Output should look something like the following:

Posted Data: name=Joe+Bloggs&age=&sex=male&submit=Perform+Post+Request...

If you go "back" to the page and then click the button again you should now see some like this:

Found HTTP_COOKIE: TEST=TEST_COOKIE

Posted Data: name=Joe+Bloggs&age=&sex=male&submit=Perform+Post+Request...

If all has gone well then it is time to install the IDE application which is done as follows:

./setup Meta meta
./install_fcgi ciyam_interface meta
./install_fcgi upload meta
./install Meta meta index

To use the application you'll need to make sure that the application server (ciyam_server) is running. To run
it under Windows use "start ciyam_server" and under Linux "./ciyam_server &". Once the application server has
started and is "listening" you are now nearly ready to create your first web application.

***************************** Extra steps if MySQL 'root' password is not blank *****************************

If you have a non-blank 'root' password for your MySQL server then this password will need to be known by the
application server in order for the 'Meta' application to be able to create (and drop) a DB. This password is
stored in the application server's main configuration file (ciyam_server.sio) in an encrypted base64 format.

Looking at the default ciyam_server.sio file you'll notice the following line:
# <sql_password>l2k34u1QZzr9oWKTqlQuaZ3nx0a=

The comment character ('#') will need to be removed and then the base64 changed to the encrypted form of your
MySQL root password. To determine the encrypted base64 password a protocol command "encrypt" exists. For ease
of use a batch/script called ./password can be used to determine the correctly encrypted password value. This
script can be used in one of two ways. The first is as follows:

./password my_password
Kd5XMcOhRxvwdg3NJ4ojNXzS6lg=

The second method is to run the script without passing the password as an argument (use this way if you don't
want the password it to be visible on the screen or kept in command history). If you use this method then you
will be prompted to type in the password (which will not be echoed).

./password
Password:
Kd5XMcOhRxvwdg3N+aggkL3j1og=

Once you have modified the <sql_password> value in "ciyam_server.sio" (and removed the # comment marker) then
you will need to stop and restart the application server (if using Windows then focus on the "cmd" window for
"ciyam_server" and type "ctrl-c" to shut it down).

*************************************************************************************************************

If all went well the you should now be able to access the IDE: http://localhost/Meta

From the login form which should have appeared use the password and user id "guest" (no quotes).
