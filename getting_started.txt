Getting Started
---------------

After cloning the repository use "make all" to build all targets and then run "do_tests" batch/script to test
that all core functionality is working:

make all
./dotests

(Windows users need to omit the ./ prefixes)

The next step is to make sure that MySQL is installed and operating. The following steps will create a DB for
testing the system, populate this DB with tables and data and check that all is functioning as expected:

./create_db ciyam
./init Meta ciyam
./test Meta_tests.sio
./drop_db ciyam

The "ciyam" DB should only be used for regression test purposes (by repeating the above steps) so now another
DB needs to be created for the IDE itself:

./create_db Meta
./init Meta Meta

The next step is to make sure that the web server's FCGI is installed and operating. Run the following batch/
script to install the FCGI testbed:

./install_test_fcgi

Assuming no errors occurred you should now be able to access the webpage: http://localhost/test_fcgi.html

It will present a HTML form with a Perform Post Request button. To verify that FCGI is working correctly next
click on the button. Output should look something like the following:

Posted Data: name=Joe+Bloggs&age=&sex=male&submit=Perform+Post+Request...

If you go "back" to the page and then click the button again you should now see some like this:

Found HTTP_COOKIE: TEST=TEST_COOKIE

Posted Data: name=Joe+Bloggs&age=&sex=male&submit=Perform+Post+Request...

If all has gone well then it is time to install the IDE application which is done as follows:

./setup Meta meta
./install_fcgi ciyam_interface meta
./install_fcgi upload meta
./install Meta meta

If all went well the you should now be able to access the IDE: http://localhost/Meta

A login form should appear which can be tested using the password and user id "guest" (no quotes).
