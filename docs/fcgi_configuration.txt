FCGI Configuration
------------------

Apache supports two different FCGI implementations. One is the module mod_fcgid which only works as a single
threaded interface but is more suited to development because it only starts an FCGI server after the initial
request is issued.

The other mod_fastcgi is more suited to a production environment as it is a multi-threaded interface and all
FCGI servers are started when Apache itself starts and a re-started automatically if they exit (or crash).

Notes for using mod_fcgid with Apache 2.2
-----------------------------------------

1) Copy mod_fcgid.so into Apache's modules directory (Windows only - otherwise ensure "mod_fcgid" installed).

2) Make the following changes to "default-server.conf" (or if no such file then change "httpd.conf" instead):
...
LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so ### (NOTE: only add this if there are other LoadModule's around)
...
#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
<Directory "/webroot">
...
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
...
    AllowOverride All
...
</Directory>
...
<IfModule fcgid_module>
   MaxProcessCount               10
   MaxRequestLen                 10485760
   IdleTimeOut                   3600
   IPCConnectTimeout             20
   IPCCommTimeout                300
</IfModule>
...

3) For some versions of Linux the "LoadModule" line might not be applicable and activating the module (after
it has been installed) might instead require the use of a script (such as "a2enmod" with OpenSUSE). Also the
name of the module for the "IfModule" test might be "mod_fcgid" rather than "fcgid_module".
