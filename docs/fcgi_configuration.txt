FCGI Configuration
------------------

Apache supports two different FCGI implementations. One is the module mod_fcgid which only works as a single
threaded interface but is more suited to development because it only starts an FCGI server after the initial
request is issued.

The other mod_fastcgi is more suited to a production environment as it is a multi-threaded interface and all
FCGI servers are started when Apache itself starts and a re-started automatically if they exit (or crash).

Notes for using mod_fcgid with Apache 2.2
-----------------------------------------

1) Install the FCGI Apache module ("a2enmod fcgid" for Linux or for Windows copy "mod_fcgid.so" into Apache's
modules directory).

2) Make the following changes to "default-server.conf" (or if no such file then change "httpd.conf" instead):
(the + prefix indicates all lines that need to be added and each + must be removed after copying and pasting)

sudo vi /etc/apache2/default-server.conf

...
### NOTE: This line is for Windows iff there are other LoadModule's present.
+LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so
...
### NOTE: These additions are for both Windows and Linux operating systems.
<Directory "/srv/www/htdocs">
...
+    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
+    AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
...
+    AllowOverride All
...
</Directory>
...
+<IfModule fcgid_module>
+   MaxProcessCount               10
+   MaxRequestLen                 10485760
+   IdleTimeOut                   3600
+   IPCConnectTimeout             20
+   IPCCommTimeout                300
+   DefaultMaxClassProcessCount   1
+   DefaultMinClassProcessCount   1
+</IfModule>
...

Also the name of the module for the "IfModule" test above might be "mod_fcgid" rather than "fcgid_module".

Once the changes have been made restart the apache2 web service:

sudo service apache2 restart
