Notes for Using Specific Packages
---------------------------------

The following notes detail the available packages and their usage. Package names that have (default) appended
to their name are Package Type's that are installed by default. Package Types not installed by default can be
used after being installed from their package (refer to "Installing Package Types" in "getting_started.txt").

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto_Code (default)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides an Auto_Code class which is used to automatically generate unique sequential codes that
can be used by instances of any other Class.

After installation to get a Class to use an "auto code" field first create a field (e.g. Code of type str010)
then add a "for_auto_code_user" Specification to the Class. In this Specification link the Field to the newly
created field (i.e. Code) and set the Value to a unique identifier for this "auto code" (e.g. user_code) then
"Save Details". Next click "Add Source Info" and select the Auto_Code Class and its "Increment" Procedure.

In order for the "auto code" to function at run-time an Auto_Code record with its key matching the identifier
that was entered as the Value in the "for_auto_code_user" Specification must exist. As records that are using
"auto codes" could have Initial_Record values (e.g. the User class) the Auto_Code records needed by the users
of them need to be created as Initial_Record instances.

Thus from the Classes child list of the Model select Auto_Code then select the Initial_Records child list and
click "New Record". The Key for the Initial Record must be the same as the Value for the "for_auto_code_user"
used (e.g. "user_code").

After creating the Initial_Record the Initial_Record_Values for Name and Mask must be provided. For the above
example the Initial_Record_Value's Value for Name could be set to "User_Code" with the Mask's Value being set
to a useful "auto increment mask" (e.g. "U#####"). It should be noted that the Name must be unique (but isn't
otherwise important).

An "auto incement mask" must contain one or more "#" or "?" characters that are replaced when determining the
"next" auto increment value with digits and letters respectively. The following table of auto code masks with
sample values illustrates how this works (note that generated letters are only upper case).

AC####  ==>  AC0000,AC0001,AC0002,...,AC9999
??####  ==>  AA0000,AA0001,AA0002,...,ZZ9999
XYZ#??  ==>  XYZ0AA,XYZ0AB,XYZ0AC,...,XYZ9ZZ

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides an Event implementation in which each record has a date and time (as well as optionally
a duration) and a status. Such records can be treated like a list of public events, but also could be handled
more like private appointments, reminders or tasks and as such can be generated from a Schedule.

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create demo events.

group_package - Optional "group" package to divide events between workgroups.

use_duration - Use this option to give an event a duration (and to allow overlap detection).
use_tz_abbr - Use this option to be able to tie a timezone abbreviation to an event.

user_package - Optional "user" package to tie events to specific users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forum
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard User

This package provides a Forum implementation that includes "boards" (with multiple levels of nested children)
that contain "topics" which in turn contain "posts". The topics are ordered according to the most recent post
with "pinned" topics always appearing first. If a topic is "locked" then posting (or post editing) below this
topic is not permitted (except by "moderators" or the "admin" user).

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create demo boards, topics and posts.
@use_home_list - Use this option to display the forum boards as a "home" list.

check_for_interim_posts - Use this option to display interim posts when attempting to save a reply post.

hot_topic_posts - This option if the number of posts a topic needs to contain to be considered as "hot".

min_posts_to_lock_own - A user can lock their own threads after they have posted this many times.

min_posts_to_rate - If using the user rating implementation then a user must post this many times before they
can rate another user.

months_before_topic_is_old - Newer topics appear with different icons to older ones.

rating_multiplier - If using the user reputation implementation then this is used to calculate the number for
reducing/increasing the rated users rating.

use_post_publishing - Use this option to force all posts to be reviewed by a moderator before publication (if
this option is used then the check_for_interim_posts option will be ignored).

use_special_boards - Use this option to allow certain boards to be restricted to users that have been granted
permission to access them.

use_tags - Use this option to allow users to create tags which they can apply to specific posts (for mods and
admin these can be used in order to split or merge threads).

use_user_access_level* - Use this option to apply the user access level to boards, threads and posts.
use_user_ignore_users* - Use this option to filter posts and threads out from users in the ignore set.
use_user_reputation* - Use this option to allow adding/subtracting reputation ratings from users for posts.

very_hot_topic_posts - As per the hot_topic_posts option.

* It should be noted that these options will have no effect if the relevant options were not set for the User
package before it was installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group (default)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard User

This package provides a Workgroup class and implements the Relationship between a User and its Workgroup. The
Relationship is optional although typically only the "admin" or "guest" user would not belong to a Workgroup.

The Workgroup (or renamed as Department if preferred) is used as a simple means of slicing DB records between
different users. Various other Packages will accept the Group Package as an option where it can make sense to
be dividing records between different Workgroups.

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create demo Workgroups (and demo Users belonging to them).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Itinerary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard User Event

This package provides a simple Itinerary imlementation that allows users to generate a "day by day" itinerary
of events for a specified date range.

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create a demo Itinerary.

use_permission - Use this option to require a permission to access Itineraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Photo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides a Photo Album implementation that can be used to easily create and publish photos from
a CIYAM application.

In order to be able to view "published" Photo Album web pages the open source application Galleria must first
be installed. A script to install Galleria (and a copy of Galleria itself) is included in the repository - so
to install it simply run the following:

./setup_galleria

If the User package is not linked to the Photo package (via the "user_package" option) then Photo Albums will
be accessible to all users and will be published to the "webroot" directory. If the User package is linked in
then Photo Albums and Photos are only visible to the user that "owns" them, however, if "use_user_account" is
selected (and User Accounts were installed with the User package) then other users that the Photo Album owner
has added User Accounts for will also be able to view their Photos (assuming they have been given high enough
access). Only those Photo Albums with "public" visibility (and Photos likewise) are able to be "published" as
the published Photo Albums will be visible to anyone having access to the website.

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create one or more demo Photo Albums (depends upon User demo data).

user_package - This needs to be linked to an installed User package in order to use the other "user" options.

use_user_account - Use this option if Photo Albums are intended to be shared between user accounts.
use_user_account_mark_as_seen - This option allows the account owners to mark a Photo Album as being seen.

use_user_id_path - Use this option to publish Photo Albums below a directory that is the same as the User Id.

use_user_permissions - Use this option to add permissions for being able to access/modify Photo Albums.
use_user_tags - Use this option in order to be able to add/remove "tags" to/from individual Photos.

user_image_directory - This is the name of the directory in which the Photos will be stored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard Event

This package allows for the scheduling of events in advance for a cycle (weekly, monthly or annually). Within
the schedule one creates separate schedule items which will be used to create the specific events. The design
is intended for scheduling meetings or regular tasks.

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create a demo schedule.

event_package - This needs to be linked to an installed "event" package.
group_package - Optional "group" package to divide schedules between workgroups.

timezone_package - Optional "timezone" package to be able to tie a timezone to a schedule.
user_package - Optional "user" package to be able to tie schedules to specific users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timezone
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides the ability to create records for different timezones that can include daylight savings
adjustments and historical changes for such. The "timezones.sio" file used by the application server can also
be generated from the timezone records.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User (default)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides the User class which is required for an application to support "logging in". To be able
to create the User instances an "admin" user is automatically created when an application is generated. To be
sure a system is secured the password for "admin" must be changed (the default password is "admin").

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create one or more demo User records.

use_access_level - Use this option to be able to assign users a specific "access" level.
use_access_level_ten_deep - If using "access level" then this option will extend the number of levels to ten.

use_account - Use this option to allow users to create accounts** that are aliases for other users.
use_account_invitation - Use this option to enable emailing of invitations to accounts for new users.

use_ignore_users - Use this option to support the maintenance of a set of users to be ignored. Other packages
(such as the Forum package) will utilise this list for the purposes of "hiding" records.

use_personalisation - Use this option to add additional personal information (such as photo and signature).

use_quick_link - Use this option to allow the user to maintain quick link*** records.
use_quick_link_active - Use this option to allow quick link records to have an "active" status.

use_reputation - Use this option to allow other packages to award or subtract reputation ratings.

use_templates - Use this option to support the creation of users from a user template (this is most useful if
the application has a need for different user "types" that have different permissions).

** An "account" is effectively an alias that one user can give to another user. The purpose of creating these
accounts is for a user to be able to provide restricted access to their personal information to another user.
These accounts can be tied with the usage of other packages (such as the Photo package) which can be used for
the construction of "social network" type applications.

*** A "quick link" is a method for extending the standard menu for an application to include menu items which
are either links to a specific record or to a specific record search.
