Development Cycle Steps
-----------------------

1. Sign up for a free GitHub account (https://github.com/signup/free) then install "git" and SSH to work with
GitHub (for Windows users refer to http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/).
 
2. You'll need a fork of the main source tree. Login to your GitHub account and then browse over to the ciyam
project (https://github.com/ciyam/ciyam) and click the small 'Fork' button near the top of the screen.
 
3. Connect that fork at GitHub with source code on your development machine. The easiest way to do that is to
clone your github fork, using the SSH Read+Write URL github shows you on your fork's page.
 
git clone git@github.com:your_github_name/ciyam.git
cd ciyam

4. Add a remote link to the main ciyam "upstream" project.

git remote add upstream git://github.com/ciyam/ciyam.git

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          [these steps are applicable to each task being worked on]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Make sure you are using your master branch and have merged all remote changes (this step is not applicable
if you have only just cloned the repository).

git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on.

git checkout -b task_branch_name
 
 ... edit, test, re-edit, re-test ...

7. Make sure that all targets have been built and then run the basic regression tests.

make all
./dotests

(if any errors then these will need to be resolved before continuing)

8. Run any more specific regression tests that could potentially be affected by your changes.

(obviously steps 7 and 9 are not applicable if all changes made do not affect the software such as docco)

9. Now commit your changes and push to your branch.

git commit -m "Added new features to satisfy specified requirements."
git push git@github.com:your_github_name/ciyam.git task_branch_name:task_branch_name
 
10. Finally submit a "pull" request by going to your fork's GitHub page and selecting the branch that has all
the changes you want pulled ("task_branch_name" in the above example) and finally clicking the "Pull Request"
button.
