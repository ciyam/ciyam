System Identity Implementation
------------------------------

Every CIYAM node requires its own "identity" in order to differentiate it from all other nodes and which also
will allow its backup data to be restored (assuming that at least one "backup peer" exists). When it is first
started a list of twelve randomly chosen words (from a small dictionary of 2048 words) appears in the browser
interface (along with fields for a master password that is used to unlock the system when it is restarted).

Keeping Your Identity Secure
----------------------------

In order to be able to later restore backup data the twelve words (also known as "mnemonics") need to kept in
a manner that is secure from theft (including being secure from hacking) and accidental loss. When starting a
node for the first time it would be recommended that no internet connection be provided until after you first
have made a copy of the twelve words (using an analog method such as pen and paper) and have also entered the
master password (which should be typed in twice manually to confirm that it is correct).

The master password is hardened (with over 185K hash operations) in order to ensure that any attempt to crack
it by brute force would take a very long time, however, it would still be recommended to use a password which
includes special characters, digits and both lower and upper case letters and which is at least 10 characters
in length.

Restoring an Existing Identity
------------------------------

If wishing to restore an already existing CIYAM system using a new node then the twelve words which initially
appear should be replaced with those that had been written down previously (the master password that had been
used before is not relevant when restoring so a new one can be provided meaning that this is also how one can
restore a system if the master password has been forgotten).

Enhancing Your Identity Security
--------------------------------

It should be noted that the dictionary being used is that defined by BIP39 (being the standard used in crypto
wallets). Although it might be a convenience to use the same words for both your crypto wallet and CIYAM node
THIS SHOULD NEVER BE DONE as it might lead to the loss of all your crypto assets.

As the dictionary is 2048 words each single word is 11 bits (1024 being 10 bits so 2048 being one extra bit).
This means that twelve words is 132 bits, however, to minimise human error the last 4 bits are being used for
a "checksum" (to detect an input mistake) so there are only 128 bits of "entropy" (or randomness) present.

This is a lot of entropy but if wanting to be "future proof" one might want to extend this even further. This
is why some crypto wallets have 18 or 24 words as an option (rather than just 12). The CIYAM node permits you
to add extra characters after the twelve words (with a space separating the last of the twelve words from the
first of the extra characters) which are used to "harden" the 128 bits of entropy (with over one million hash
operations being performed after combining the extra characters with the seed value of the twelve mnemonics).

It should be noted that any extra characters provided are *not* BIP39 mnemonics and so if entered incorrectly
will simply result in the wrong identity (with no error being issued) so be very careful when recording these
along with the other twelve words for safe keeping.

Identity and Mnemonic Passphrase Examples
-----------------------------------------

These are both sample blockchains that have been created purely for testing purposes:

Mnemonics: detect jazz kick ghost novel rifle scout mirror stairs craft outdoor crisp

Identity: 6b24210e8
Mnemonics: taxi act describe attitude focus ugly govern outer note isolate endless act

It should be noted that an identity is always either 9 or 10 characters long (as the identity can be reversed
for usage with the "shared" folder therefore it will be 10 characters long if 9 characters are palindromic).

Using additonal characters in order to create a more "future proof" identity:
