System Identity Implementation
------------------------------

Every CIYAM node requires its own "identity" in order to differentiate it from all other nodes and which also
will allow its backup data to be restored (assuming that at least one "backup peer" exists). When it is first
started a list of twelve randomly chosen words (from a small dictionary of 2048 words) appears in the FCGI UI
dialog (along with a master password that is used for unlocking the system when this is required).

Keeping Your Identity Secure
----------------------------

In order to be able to later restore backup data the twelve words (also known as "mnemonics") need to kept in
a manner that is secure from theft (including being secure from hacking) and accidental loss. When starting a
node for the first time it would be recommended that no internet connection be present until after you make a
copy of the twelve words (using an analog method such as pen and paper) and have entered the master password.

Restoring an Existing Identity
------------------------------

If wishing to restore an already existing CIYAM system using a new node then the twelve words which initially
appear should be replaced with those that had been written down previously (the master password that had been
used before is not important so if it was not remembered then a new one can now be used).

Enhancing Your Identity Security
--------------------------------

It should be noted that the dictionary being used is that defined in BIP39 (being the standard used in crypto
wallets). Although it might be a convenience to use the same words for both your crypto wallet and CIYAM node
THIS SHOULD NEVER BE DONE as it might lead to the loss of all your crypto assets.

As the dictionary is 2048 words each single word is 11 bits (1024 being 10 bits so 2048 being one extra bit).
This means that twelve words is 132 bits, however, to minimise human error the last 4 bits are being used for
a "checksum" (to detect an input mistake) so there are only 128 bits of "entropy" (or randomness) present.

This is a lot of entropy but if wanting to be "future proof" one might want to extend this even further. This
is why some crypto wallets have 18 or 24 words as an option (rather than just 12). The CIYAM node permits you
to add extra characters after the twelve words (with a space separating the last of the twelve words from the
first of the extra characters) which are used to "harden" the 128 bits of entropy (with over one million hash
operations being performed after combining the extra characters with the seed value of the twelve mnemonics).

It should be noted that any extra characters provided are *not* BIP39 mnemonics and so if entered incorrectly
will simply result in the wrong identity (with no error being issued) so be very careful when recording these
along with the other twelve words for safe keeping.
