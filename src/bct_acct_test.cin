; CIYAM Bitcoin test script for ACCT using either a CLTV or secret reveal redemption tx
; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; NOTE: In order to utilise the following script you will first need to install Bitcoin
; into the directory where CIYAM has been compiled or else set the TBITCOIN environment
; variable accordingly (check the 'tbitcoin' script to work out how to do this and when
; doing this don't forget the '-regtest' option). Check that there is no 'regtest' data
; before running this script.
;
; As this script uses four different wallets you will need to create four scripts named
; bct1, bct2, bct3 and bct4 which each should first delete the current 'regtest' wallet
; and then if a saved wallet exists copy that to wallet.dat. After bitcoin has finished
; running then the current wallet will be copied so it can be restored later.
