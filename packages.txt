Notes for Using Specific Packages
---------------------------------

The following notes detail the available packages and their usage. Package names that have (default) appended
to their name are Package Type's that are installed by default. Package Types not installed by default can be
used after being installed from their package (refer to "Installing Package Types" in "getting_started.txt").

Auto_Code (default)
-------------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard

This package provides an Auto_Code class which is used to automatically generate unique sequential codes that
can be used by instances of any other Class.

After installation to get a Class to use an "auto code" field first create a field (e.g. Code of type str010)
then add a "for_auto_code_user" Specification to the Class. In this Specification link the Field to the newly
created field (i.e. Code) and set the Value to a unique identifier for this "auto code" (e.g. user_code) then
"Save Details". Next click "Add Source Info" and select the Auto_Code Class and its "Increment" Procedure.

In order for the "auto code" to function at run-time an Auto_Code record with its key matching the identifier
that was entered as the Value in the "for_auto_code_user" Specification must exist. As records that are using
"auto codes" could have Initial_Record values (e.g. the User class) the Auto_Code records needed by the users
of them need to be created as Initial_Record instances.

Thus from the Classes child list of the Model select Auto_Code then select the Initial_Records child list and
click "New Record". The Key for the Initial Record must be the same as the Value for the "for_auto_code_user"
used (e.g. "user_code").

After creating the Initial_Record the Initial_Record_Values for Name and Mask must be provided. For the above
example the Initial_Record_Value's Value for Name could be set to "User_Code" with the Mask's Value being set
to a useful "auto increment mask" (e.g. "U#####"). It should be noted that the Name must be unique (but isn't
otherwise important).

An "auto incement mask" must contain one or more "#" or "?" characters that are replaced when determining the
"next" auto increment value with digits and letters respectively. The following table of auto code masks with
sample values illustrates how this works (note that generated letters are only upper case).

AC####  ==>  AC0000,AC0001,AC0002,...,AC9999
??####  ==>  AA0000,AA0001,AA0002,...,ZZ9999
XYZ#??  ==>  XYZ0AA,XYZ0AB,XYZ0AC,...,XYZ9ZZ

Group (default)
---------------

Other Package Dependencies: Standard User

This package provides a Workgroup class and implements the Relationship between a User and its Workgroup. The
Relationship is optional although typically only the "admin" or "guest" user would not belong to a Workgroup.

The Workgroup (or renamed as Department if preferred) is used as a simple means of slicing DB records between
different users. Various other Packages will accept the Group Package as an option where it can make sense to
be dividing records between different Workgroups.

Package Options:

@use_demo_data - Use this option to create demo Workgroups (and demo Users belonging to them).
