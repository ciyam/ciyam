FCGI Configuration
------------------

Apache supports two different FCGI implementations. One is the module mod_fcgid which only works as a single
threaded interface but is more suited to development because it only starts an FCGI server after the initial
request is issued.

The other mod_fastcgi is more suited to a production environment as it is a multi-threaded interface and all
FCGI servers are started when Apache itself starts and a re-started automatically if they exit (or crash).

Notes for using mod_fcgid with Apache 2.2
-----------------------------------------

1) Copy mod_fcgid.so into Apache's modules directory.

2) Make the following changes to "httpd.conf" (found in Apache's "conf" directory):
...
LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so
...
#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
<Directory "c:/webroot">
...
    Options Indexes ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
...
    AllowOverride All
...
</Directory>
...
<IfModule fcgid_module>
   AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
   MaxProcessCount               10
   MaxRequestLen                 10485760
   IdleTimeOut                   3600
   IPCConnectTimeout             20
   IPCCommTimeout                300
</IfModule>
...
