CIYAM Software Manufacturing Environment
----------------------------------------

The following environment variables are required by various scripts:

Name   Description                 Sample Value
-----  -----------------           ------------
CPPENV C++ Compiler (Windows only) vc80
WEBDIR Web Document Root path      /srv/www/htdocs
WEBSVC www service name            apache2

Environment variables LIB and INCLUDE for VC++ will require additions for MySQL and (if used) OpenSSL.

The following are platform specific instructions for installing 3rd party libraries:

NOTE: To make things easier for Windows developers some .lib and .dll files have been included.


MySQL
-----
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

[Linux]

Is normally standard but you may need to install the appropriate developer package (e.g. mysql-devel).

[Windows]

When installing make sure that the option for "Development libraries and headers" is selected.

For VC++ the LIB environment variable will need this added (replace <ver> with the MySQL version):
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server <ver>\lib\opt
e.g. set LIB=C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\lib\opt;%LIB%

For VC++ the INCLUDE environment variable will need this added (replace <ver> with the MySQL version):
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server <ver>\include
e.g. set INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\include;%INCLUDE%


FastCGI
-------
http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/

[Linux]

tar -zxvf fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
cd fcgi-2.4.0

./configure
make
su
make install

[Windows]

nmake -f Makefile.nt

copy libfcgi\Release\libfcgi.dll <dest directory>
copy libfcgi\Release\libfcgi.lib <dest directory>


Haru PDF Library
----------------
http://libharu.org/files

[Linux]

tar -zxvf libharu-2.1.0.tar.gz
cd libharu-2.1.0

./configure
make
su
make install

cp /usr/local/lib/libhpdf-2.1.0.so /usr/lib (depending upon distro)

[Windows]

unzip -j \tmp\libharu-2.1.0-vc8.zip lib_dll/libhpdf.lib lib_dll/libhpdf.dll

mkdir haru
cd haru
unzip -j \tmp\libharu-2.1.0-vc8.zip include/*


OpenSSL
-------
http://www.openssl.org/

[Linux]

tar xzf openssl-1.0.0a.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.0.0a

./config shared
make
make test
su
make install

cp /usr/local/ssl/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib (depending upon distro)
cp /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib (depending upon distro)

[Windows]

Download and run the installation program.

For VC++ the LIB environment variable will need this added:
C:\OpenSSL-Win32\lib
e.g. set LIB=C:\OpenSSL-Win32\lib;%LIB%

For VC++ the INCLUDE environment variable will need this added:
C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include
e.g. set INCLUDE=C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include;%INCLUDE%

Note that "ciyam_server.pem" is a test public/private key pair encrypted with the password "password".
